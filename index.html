	<h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
	<h4>In this section you will:</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>create a GitHub account</li>
		<li>create your own fork of a repository</li>
		<li>create a new Git branch</li>
		<li>edit and commit a file on GitHub</li>
		<li>make a pull request</li>
		<li>merge upstream changes into your fork</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>What is it?</h1>
	Git is a source code management system, designed to support collaboration.

	GitHub is a web-based service that hosts Git projects, including Django itself: https://github.com/django/django.

	The key idea in Git is that it’s distributed. If you’re not already familiar with version control systems, then explaining why this is important will only introduce distinctions and complications that you don’t need to worry about, so that’s the last thing I will say on the subject.

	<h1>Set up a GitHub account</h1>
	sign up at GitHub if you don’t already have an account
	It’s free.

	<h1>Some basic editing on GitHub</h1>
	<h4>Forking</h4>
	visit https://github.com/evildmp/afraid-to-commit/
	You can do various things there, including browsing through all the code and files.

	<h4>hit the Fork button</h4>
	A few moments later, you’ll have your own copy, on GitHub, of everything in that repository, and from now on you’ll do your work on your copy of it.

	Your copy is at https://github.com/<your github account>/afraid-to-commit/.
